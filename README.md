New world
Action is character. If we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody.
Don't hide, don't be afraid of the dark, follow the lights, then you can find tomorrow.
We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be.
Life is always so we covered all over with cuts and bruises, but later, the injured area will become the strong place.
